# EDA-ON-INDIAN-CRUDE-OIL-PRICES


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian crude oil prices is a comprehensive study that delves into the trends and patterns observed in the data obtained from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). The dataset spans from the year 2000 to 2020, encompassing a significant period of time that allows for a thorough analysis of the crude oil price dynamics in India.

The EDA begins by examining the basic statistics and distribution of the crude oil prices over the years. Utilizing the power of matplotlib.pyplot, various graphs such as line plots, histograms, and box plots are generated to visualize the overall price trends and identify any potential outliers or seasonality in the data. Additionally, plotly.express is leveraged to create interactive visualizations that enable a more in-depth exploration of the price movements over time.

One of the key aspects of the EDA is to analyze the impact of significant events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on crude oil prices. To achieve this, the data is segmented into two periods: before and after the onset of the pandemic. Comparative analysis using line plots and bar graphs helps to understand the drastic price fluctuations and demand-supply imbalances during this critical period.

Further, the EDA investigates the correlation between crude oil prices and other economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation rates, and international oil prices. This analysis provides insights into the interdependencies between various factors that influence the fluctuations in Indian crude oil prices.

Overall, the EDA on Indian crude oil prices provides valuable insights into the historical trends, seasonal variations, and significant events that have shaped the dynamics of the country's oil market. The use of different graphical representations enhances the understanding of the data, while the focus on pre and post-COVID periods highlights the unique challenges and opportunities faced by the oil industry during this unprecedented time. The findings from this exploratory analysis can serve as a foundation for more advanced modeling and decision-making in the energy sector.
